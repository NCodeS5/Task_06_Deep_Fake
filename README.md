# Research Task 6 ‚Äî Deep-Fake Interview (Video-Only with Sora) üé•


## 1) Overview
This project transforms my earlier SU sports narrative (season stats + recommendations) into a **synthetic ‚Äústreet interview‚Äù video**. I used **OpenAI Sora** to generate a 20‚Äì30s, realistic TV-style clip where **I appear as the interviewer** (face only) speaking with the Syracuse men‚Äôs basketball coach outside the **Carrier Dome**.  
No audio or TTS was used; the final artifact is **video-only** (silent).

---

## 2) Concept & Rationale
- **Format:** On-the-street sports interview, news-style.
- **Characters:**  
  - **Interviewer:** Me (only my **face** is used; body/clothes are AI-generated).  
  - **Coach:** AI-generated person in **orange Syracuse jacket**.
- **Setting:** Outside the **Syracuse University Carrier Dome** with fans walking by.
- **Why this format:** An interview is a natural way to ‚Äúperform‚Äù my narrative insights (defensive strengths, shooting weaknesses, offseason focus) without producing a long documentary. It also stress-tests modern video generators‚Äô ability to handle **identity transfer** (my face), **camera language**, and **background motion**.

## 3) Tools
- **Primary:** OpenAI **Sora** (text ‚Üí video with reference image)
- **Inputs:** A high-quality **photo of my face** (front-facing, well-lit), the text prompt (below)
- **No Audio:** I did **not** add TTS/voiceover. The clip is silent.

---

## 4) Sora Prompt (Used As-Is)
Generate a realistic short sports interview clip.
Use the uploaded photo of Neha‚Äôs face for the interviewer character only.
The interviewer is holding a microphone and standing outside the Syracuse University Carrier Dome,
speaking with the men‚Äôs basketball coach in an orange Syracuse jacket.
Fans in Syracuse team gear walk in the background.
The style should look like a professional TV sports interview, with natural gestures,
smooth camera cuts between interviewer and coach, and clear facial expressions.
Only Neha‚Äôs face should be used on the interviewer ‚Äî keep the body, clothing, and background generated by the model.
The video should be 20‚Äì30 seconds in 1080p quality.

## 5) Ethical Considerations
- **Consent & Scope:** I used **my own face** and a **fictional coach**. No real person was impersonated.
- **Disclosure:** This artifact is labeled as **AI-generated** to avoid misleading viewers.
- **Non-malicious Use:** The video demonstrates **creative research**; not used for deception or harm.
