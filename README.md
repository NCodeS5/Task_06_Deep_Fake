## Research Task 6 ‚Äî Deep-Fake Interview (Video with CapCut) üé•  

### 1) Overview  
This project transforms my earlier Syracuse University sports narrative (season stats + recommendations) into a **synthetic ‚Äúinterview-style‚Äù video**. I used **CapCut AI Video Generator** to create a 20‚Äì30 second, realistic TV-style clip simulating a **post-game interview**.  
No custom audio or TTS was added; the final artifact is **video-only** (silent).

### 2) Concept & Rationale  
- **Format:** Sports interview, broadcast-style.  
- **Characters:**  
  - **Interviewer:** AI-generated woman resembling a sports reporter.  
  - **Coach:** AI-generated Syracuse coach in **orange and navy team attire**.  
- **Setting:** Inside the **trophy room** and outside the **Carrier Dome** (two variations tested).  
- **Why this format:** An interview format is a natural way to deliver the narrative insights (team strengths, weaknesses, standout players). It also allowed me to explore how AI tools like CapCut handle **script generation, character design, and sports-themed settings**.

### 3) Tools  
- **Primary:** CapCut (AI Video Generator, free version)  
- **Inputs:**  
  - Text prompts (for interviewer, coach, and setting details)  
  - Example sports data/narrative from earlier assignments  
- **Output:** 20‚Äì30 second **silent video clip**

### 4) Example Prompt (Used in CapCut)  
```text
Create a medium two-shot interview scene. The interviewer is an Indian woman in casual attire, 
seated opposite a female coach in her 40s‚Äì50s, athletic build, wearing official Syracuse University 
lacrosse coaching gear in orange and navy. They are inside the team‚Äôs trophy room, with championship 
trophies gleaming in the background. Generate a short interview-style clip with natural gestures 
and expressions, as if it‚Äôs part of a sports TV segment.
